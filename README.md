# TicTacToeGUI

**Extended Description:** A simple TicTacToe GUI application that pits one player against a computer opponent. Written in PyQt6.

Note: What can be seen so far was done in one to two days and so does not illustrate most of my programming skills. I am hoping to include a more advanced choice system for the computer choice
